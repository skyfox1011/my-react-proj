                Right after the Tokyo Tekken Masters event concluded in Japan, both Knee and Noroma made their way to the nearby 
                Akihabara Leisure Land arcade to do some deathmatches. These are high level, Fujin ranked Korea VS Japan deathmatches 
                with the most dominating Korean player in the world when it comes to deathmatching up against the rising star Japanese 
                Jack player; Noroma from Kyushu. Since the matches took place at the arcade Kuro Kuro frequents, these were all 
                streamed live on his Twitch channel with the video archive now up for viewing so big thanks to him for streaming 
                the matches. You can watch the whole thing right now on his YouTube page.

                    If you have ever been following the Japanese Tekken scene for the past few games, the name Hari (はりー) might be 
                    familiar. He's a notable Lee player who is at this point in time, currently Japan's highest ranked Lee player in arcades. 
                    He was also a really high ranker back in Tekken 6 and Tekken Tag 2 arcades so he knows his way around using Lee. 
                    Recently, Hari has been recording his matches online in Tekken 7 and uploaded footage of him deathmatching Korean 
                    players; Knee and Ji3MoonAce. These matches make for a good watch despite the online Japan to Korea connection so 
                    take note if you're interested in playing Lee. His matches with Knee & Ji3MoonAce can be found below but, you can find even
                    more of his online adventures over on this Youtube channel:

                    The Game Spot Versus arcade located in the Nishi-Nippori area of Tokyo, Japan has recently been streaming high level deathmatches 
                    over on its Twitch and YouTube channels. Recent uploads over on there see Taisei; who you may remember seeing in the 
                    Top 8 of Tekken at Evo this year playing against the high ranked Japanese Paul player Penguin. As of looking at the Japanese 
                    Tekken-Net rankings right now, Taisei is 2nd with Shaheen and Penguin is 8th with Paul. If you happen to be 
                    picking up or playing these characters, consider watching these matches to get an idea on how to play them.
